###TODO:
- ~~(done)add binding between user and (done)trips + (done)blog posts // probable work flow:~~
    - ~~change model~~
    - ~~remove data~~
    - ~~render trips based on condition: currentUser === (done)trip.createdBy~~
    - ~~render posts based on condition: currentUser === (done)post.createdBy~~
- ~~change date of trip to allow from-to~~
- ~~form validation~~
- too many requests on home
- ~~add PageNotFound~~
- edit page and trip?
- ~~searching posts doesnt work~~
- research quasar on current project, probably too hard to moved this to cli
- ~~maybe add a home page i.e. BEFORE login/register~~
- ~~if no blog posts exist - render proper message~~
- ~~render shorter text in /blog to make sense of "read more"~~
- do something about delete method - too much repeated code
                // eslint-disable-next-line no-console
