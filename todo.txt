TODO:
- add binding between user and trips + blog posts // probable work flow:
    - change model
    - remove data
    - render trips based on condition: currentUser === trip.createdBy
    - render posts based on condition: currentUser === post.createdBy
- can styles be separate?
- change date of trip to allow from-to
- form validation
- too many requests on home
- add PageNotFound
- edit page and trip?
- searching trips doesnt work
- research quasar on current project, probably too hard to moved this to cli
- maybe add a home page i.e. BEFORE login/register
                // eslint-disable-next-line no-console
